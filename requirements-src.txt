# This file allows you to install python libraries you are developing
# into the docker image.
# The libraries should installed as editable (-e passed)
# the editable library is typically cloned under a .src directory first
# e.g. `git clone https/github.cyanoptics.com/rasdk/cymlrest.git .src/cymlrest`
# next you want to make a docker image with the library installed so you add
# the requirments line to this file.
# e.g. `-e .src/cymlrest`
# now run `make image-dev` to make a docker image which with install
# that library such that it is still editable in your development environment
